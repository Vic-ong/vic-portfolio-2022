              Born in a small town called Port Dickson, in Malaysia, and moved to the US for my bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering.
              On my first job, I discovered my passion in computer science and decided to switch over to the software side in 2016. I've been a developer ever since then!
            </div>

            <div>
              Currently, I'm pursuing my Master's in Digital Media, focusing on development in the 3D space with Unreal Engine. I develop
              <span class="font-semibold">cinematic and interactive experiences i.e. animations, games, and virtual tours</span>
              by collaborating with artists, designers, and writers to materialize creative visions.
            </div>

            <div>
              In the past, I've also built web applications and APIs for companies of various industries ranging from the entertainment to consulting and fintech. Outside of work, I like to wind down with outdoor activities such as photography, team sports, and caf√© hopping!
