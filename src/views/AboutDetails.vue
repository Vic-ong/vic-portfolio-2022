              Born in a small, quaint town called Port Dickson located in the south of Malaysia, where the beach is just a 5-minute walk away from my parent's house.
              I moved to the US in 2013 to pursue my bachelor's in Mechanical Engineering but I became very interested in computer science during my first job at
              Disney World. I was, fortunately, able to get an app development project from my manager to develop an attraction reliability tool for the theme parks.
              Eventually, I made the switch to software development through online resources and learning from the seniors in the company‚ÄîI've been a software developer ever since!

              In the past, I've built web applications and APIs for companies in various industries (entertainment, consulting, fintech, and e-commerce) using tools such as
              Vue, React, Node, Python, AWS, Firebase, and Terraform. Outside of work, you'd mostly likely find me winding down with outdoorsy stuff such as team sports, caf√© hopping or
